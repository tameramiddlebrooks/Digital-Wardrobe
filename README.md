**Built With**

Built using Swift.

**Dependencies**

Sketch, and a code editor (I used Xcode).

**Game Creation Approach**

My approach to creating the game was first mapping out all of the features I would need to meet all of my minimum viable requirements within my 3-week deadline. I started off with using Sketch to create clothing assets for the character model to be dressed with, knowing that would take me some time. Once that was done I made the character model itself, then moved on to coding. I gave the screen a background, imported my assets and got to work on the drag and drop feature, which I completed after 4 days of consistent work.

**Post-MVP**
I plan on uploading the current version to test flight, and will use feedback to inform my updates. My current update plans include an updated character model, a clothing default for the character model to be wearing when the user opens the app, more clothing assets, and the ability for clothes to 'snap' into place when placed on the character model.
